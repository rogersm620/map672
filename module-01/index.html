<h2>Reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto</h2>
    <p> As someone who is new to the world of mapping, <i>The Floating Sheep Manifesto</i> is an interesting dive right into the heart of the mapping world &mdahs; a world that is probably much larger and complex than I initially thought. While the document is lighthearted, it is obvious that the authors take much pride in the art and science of making maps, and ultimately want others to care just as much.</p>
    
    <p>If I were to position myself among the coder/cartographer/critic community described in <i>The Floating Sheep Manifesto</i>, I might place myself somewhere among the ranks of the cartographers &mdsash; leaning slightly towards the coders. My real interest in joining the New Maps Plus was to learn to make interesting, appealing maps that people would want to look at and explore. These interest likely place me square in the camp of Cartographers. However, the new world of interactivity, and the tools that go along with it, can enhance that experience, and thus cannot be ignored. Moving forward in this mapping program (and after), I hope to gain enough understanding to use all the tools I’m given to make interesting, appealing maps that incorporate  new technology. But I also think it important to learn to think critically about maps, and incorporate the third figure spoke of in the Manifesto. Creating a map that tells a story is a wonderful thing, but only if you are not twisting the story to mislead the reader. The creator of the map wields much power in this regard, and must balance highlighting the purpose of a given map, with telling the whole story. All maps lie. But they shouldn’t be deceitful. </p>
    
    <p>Of the six manifesto points, I find my self drawn to one in particular: <b>#5a. Map or be mapped/#5b. But not everything can (or should) be mapped. </b> Mostly, because I cannot decided which side of this argument I agree with (which is the whole point, I suppose). I will admit that I do not have in depth knowledge of the Bowman Expeditions in Oaxaca (only what I’ve read through a few different webpages). However, the story supports the first part of the dialectical tension: Map or be mapped. The lack of data for the area created an opportunity. There was a big hole on the map, so someone filled it. I understand that some communities lack the resources to “map themselves,” maybe the solution is to provide opportunities and resources, rather than avoid it all together.</p>
